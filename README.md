# toyLIFE

toyLIFE is a computational model inspired by cellular biology. It was created to study the genotype-phenotype map at cellular level from first principles. If you are unfamiliar with the model, please read the file "toyLIFE.pdf" in which all details are explained.

# Compiling

toyLIFE is written in C++, so you will only need a C compiler and cmake in order to start. An example file, "example.cpp" is supplied to show how to code with this library. If you want to create your own programs, I would suggest modifying "example.cpp" and running everything within the "toylife" folder.
