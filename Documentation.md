## Lookup Tables

Every toyLIFE program must start with an initialization of a ToyPlugin object, using the default constructor. This creates an instance of the class ToyPlugin that contains the relevant lookup tables and allows us to compute phenotypes from genotypes.

## Genotype Format

Genotypes in toyLIFE are binary strings, stored in the program's memory as a C++ `std::string`. String sizes must be multiples of 20, because toyLIFE genotypes are formed by a group of genes of length 20. That is why in `example.cpp` the relevant variable needed when creating a new genotype is `gene_number`, the number of genes.

## Creating and Mutating a Genotype

`std::string random_genotype(int gene_number, std::uniform_real_distribution<double>& RNG, std::default_random_engine& generator);`
  
`std::string mutation(const std::string& genotype, int pos);`


The function `random_genotype` takes as an argument the number of genes we want for our genotype, and the random number generator from C++. Mutating a genotype is as simple as calling function `mutation(genotype, pos)`, where `pos` is the position in the string that we want to mutate. 

## Regulatory Phenotype

`std::vector<int> ToyPlugin::regulatory_phenotype(const std::string& genotype);`
  
The first relevant phenotype we may want to look at in toyLIFE is the regulatory one. Given a collection of genes (a genotype), toyLIFE's rules give rise to a Boolean regulatory logic, which assigns to each regulatory state an output. In a Boolean model, genes can be ON or OFF, and thus there are 2^n possible regulatory states. For instance, the state (1,0,0) in a 3-gene genotype means that gene 1 is expressed, but gene 2 and gene 3 are not. We can write each regulatory state as an `int` if we see them as binary numbers: state (1,0,0) is number 4.

So the output of function `regulatory_phenotype` is a `std::vector<int>` containing at position *i* the regulatory output of state *i*. If this doesn't make sense, go read `toyLIFE.pdf` or any text on Boolean networks. If after that nothing makes sense, you can write me an email!

## Metabolic Phenotype

`std::vector<int> ToyPlugin::metabolic_phenotype(const std::string& genotype, const std::vector<std::string>& env);` 
 
The other relevant phenotype in toyLIFE is the metabolic one. There are 274 different metabolites of up to length 8, and 60 of them can't be catabolized (see `toyLIFE.pdf`, section 'A note on toyMetabolites'). The default setting is that we want to check which of all 214 breakable metabolites a genotype is able to catabolize. Therefore, the ToyPlugin class already initializes the vector `env` with all metabolites. But you can decide to study just a subset of all metabolites: if that is the case, just create a vector of `std::string` containing the metabolites (up to size 8) that you want to study. The function `metabolic_phenotype(genotype, env)` returns a `std::vector<int>` containing a 1 in position *i* if the metabolite in position *i* in your `env` vector is catabolized by this genotype, and 0 otherwise. 

## Robustness

`double ToyPlugin::metabolic_robustness(const std::string& genotype, const std::vector<int>& phen, const std::vector<std::string>& env);`
	      
`double ToyPlugin::regulatory_robustness(const std::string& genotype, const std::vector<int>& logic_vector);`

An important property of genotype-phenotype maps is robustness, or the fraction of neutral neighbors a sequence has. The functions `regulatory_robustness`and `metabolic_robustness` compute this number for a given genotype. Both functions take as a second argument the phenotype of our current genotype, so that you don't have to compute it again, and the metabolic case also takes as an argument the vector `env` defining the metabolic environment.

## Evolvability
		
`std::map<std::vector<int>, int> ToyPlugin::metabolic_evolvability(const std::string& genotype, const std::vector<int>& phen, const std::vector<std::string>& env);`

`std::map<std::vector<int>, int> ToyPlugin::regulatory_evolvability(const std::string& genotype, const std::vector<int>& logic_vector);`


In the same way, we can compute the evolvability of a sequence, that is, how many different phenotypes are in the neighborhood of a sequence. The output here is a `std::map<std::vector<int>, int>`. The key of this map is the phenotype of a neighboring sequence, and its value is the number of times it appears in the neighborhood.
